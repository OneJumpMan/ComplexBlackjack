# ComplexBlackjack

# Overview

This is a slight twist on the classic card game blackjack, implemented as a text-only terminal game.

I created this game in order to familiarize myself with the Kotlin language, which I hope to use in future projects.

# Development Environment

This poeject was completed in the Intellij IDE. No external libraries were used - this is all vanilla Kotlin.

# Future Work

This game still has a few bugs, as seen in the video. I'd like to fix those one day.
I'd also like to build a proper user interface on top of this game logic. Potentially even make a mobile game around it.
